To make this project work you first need to open the "config.php" file and make the respective constants resonate with your database
DBHOST - most likely "127.0.0.1"
DBUSER - most likely "root"
DBPASS - most likely ""
DBNAME - most likely not yet created
make sure that you make a db which is empty and have the name represent what it is supposed to be:
haarmanict, haarman_project

the uploaded username and password are case sensitive and are
USERNAME = "admin"
PASSWORD = "root"
